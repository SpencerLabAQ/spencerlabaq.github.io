The **SPENCER Lab**'s objective is the study of techniques and methodologies for the analysis and optimization of the performance of software systems, also in combination with other software quality attributes.
<!--The approaches studied address different phases of the software development cycle (from the design phase to the release phase) and can be categorized into three different macro-areas:
software quality optimization by exploring architectural alternatives through model-based quality analysis (design phase);
performance testing (pre-release phase);
Automatic identification of critical performance issues and support for their resolution (release phase).-->
